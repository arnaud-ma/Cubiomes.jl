# Cubiomes.jl

Cubiomes.jl is a Julia port of the [Cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) C library. It allows to imitate the structure and biome generation of Minecraft worlds very fast and efficiently. Compared to the original C library, `Cubiomes.jl` is faster and much easier to use thanks to Julia.

Julia can be run in a script using `julia script.jl`, in the REPL by typing `julia` and then writing the code, in a jupyter notebook, in a pluto notebook, etc.

## Examples

Find a mushroom fields biome at a predefined location:

```julia
using Cubiomes
using Base.Iterators: countfrom

function search_biome_at(x, z, y)
    overworld = Overworld(undef, mcv"1.18")

    for seed in countfrom(zero(UInt64))
        set_seed!(overworld, seed)
        biome = get_biome(overworld, x, z, y)

        if biome == Biomes.mushroom_fields
            println("Seed $(signed(seed)) has a Mmushroom Fields at $((x, z, y))")
            break
        end
    end
end

search_biome_at(0, 0, 63)
```

Generate a map of biomes and save it as an image:

```julia
using Cubiomes
using FileIO

const overworld1_18 = Overworld(undef, mcv"1.18")
const worldmap = WorldMap(x=-1000:1000, z=-1000:1000, y=63)

function save_as_img!(worldmap, seed, path)
    set_seed!(overworld1_18, seed)
    gen_biomes!(overworld1_18, worldmap, üìè"1:16")

    world2d = view2d(worldmap)
    save(path, to_color(world2d))
end

save_as_img!(worldmap, 42, "world.png")
```

The image `world.png`:
